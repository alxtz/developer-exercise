# havn't developed in ruby before, but there should be couple of ways to do this

1. keep the full sentence string and do something like the "replace()" method
2. "split()" the str and put them back together

The first method requires some regex, debugging both regex & ruby might be a pain for me(first time doing ruby), I'll go with the second method


I think it would be something like spliting by spaces, but when marklarize the words, the none alphabet characters should be reserved

But I found out the regex I tested with JavaScript is not even that hard, and with the secound method I still has to do "replace()" in something like "Trump(covfefe)"
